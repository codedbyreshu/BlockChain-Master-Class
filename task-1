#Anti-Money Laundering (AML)

What is AML?
Anti-Money Laundering (AML) refers to laws, rules, and processes designed to prevent criminals from disguising illegally obtained money as legitimate income.

In short:
AML stops dirty money from entering the financial system.
________________________________________
How Money Laundering Happens
Money laundering usually has 3 stages:
1️. Placement – Illegal money is introduced into the system
2️. Layering – Multiple transactions hide the source
3️. Integration – Money appears legal and usable
AML exists to detect and block these stages.
________________________________________
Key Components of AML
•	KYC (Know Your Customer) – Verify user identity
•	Transaction Monitoring – Track suspicious activity
•	Risk Assessment – Identify high-risk users or regions
•	Reporting – File suspicious activity reports (SARs)
•	Compliance Checks – Follow government regulations
________________________________________
AML in Crypto & Blockchain
•	Exchanges must verify users
•	Wallet activity is monitored
•	Large or unusual transfers are flagged
•	Blockchain analytics track fund movement
Even though crypto is decentralized, AML compliance is mandatory for platforms.
