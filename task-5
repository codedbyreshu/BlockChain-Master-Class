 How Crypto ATMs Work (Brief & Easy)

Crypto ATMs are machines similar to bank ATMs but built for cryptocurrencies:

🔹 What they allow

✔ Buy crypto (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, USDT) with cash or card
✔ Sell crypto for cash (on some machines)

Some machines are one-way (only buy), and some are two-way (buy and sell).

🔹 How a transaction happens

User approaches the ATM

Selects coin to buy or sell

Enters wallet address (or scans QR code)

Pays cash or card

Crypto is sent to the wallet

For sales: crypto sent to ATM, user gets cash

🔹 Things to know

Machines often support Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and popular stablecoins like USDT

Fees can be higher than online exchanges

Some machines require phone number or KYC

Availability is not guaranteed — some listings may be inactive
